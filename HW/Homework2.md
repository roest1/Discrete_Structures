1. Prove or disprove that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number
is irrational

p → q := Let x be a rational number with x ≠ 0 and let y be an irrational number, then xy is irrational.

Proof by contradiction : 

¬ q := xy is rational 

SO xy = $\frac{a}{b}

3. Prove that for all $n ∈ \mathbb{N}$,

$$1^2 + 4^2 + 7^2 + 10^2 + · · · + (3n − 2)^2 = \frac{n(6n^2 − 3n − 1)}{2}$$

5. 

- (a) In how many ways can two numbers be selected from {1, 2, . . . , 100} so that their sum
is an even number? How about the ways that their sum is an odd number?



- (b) Use a combinatorial argument to show that $C(2n, 2) = 2C(n, 2) + n^2$

6. There are 6 boys and 4 girls. How many ways can they be divided into groups of 2 persons,
such that there is no group with two girls?

---

7. In how many ways can the 26 letters in the English alphabet be arranged so that there are
exactly seven letters between the letters a and b?

---

8. How many non-negative integer solutions are there to the equation $2x_1+2x_2+x_3+x_4 = 12$?

---

9. In how many ways can 22 different books be given to 5 students so that 2 of them will
have 5 books and the other 3 will have 4 books?

---

10. Prove the following for all integer n ≥ 1 by mathematical induction :

- (a)

$$1 × 3 + 2 × 4 + 3 × 5 + · · · + n(n + 2) = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 7)}{6}$$

---

11. Show that it is possible to arrange the numbers $1, 2, . . . , n$ in a row so that the average of
any two of these numbers never appears between them.
[Hint: Show that it suffices to prove this fact when n is a power of 2. Then use mathematical
induction to prove the result when n is a power of 2.]
