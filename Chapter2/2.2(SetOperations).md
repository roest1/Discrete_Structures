# 2.2 Set Operations

Sets can be combined in many ways.

### Definition

> Let A and B be sets. The *union* of the sets A and B, denoted by $A ∪ B$, is the set that contains those elements that are either in A or in B, or both.

Example :

$$\{1, 3, 5\} ∪ \{1, 2, 4\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$

### Definition

> Let A and B be sets. The *intersection* of the sets A and B, denoted by $A ∩ B$, is the set containing those elements in both A and B.

$$A ∩ B = \{x \text{ | } x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B\}$$

Example :

$$\{1, 3, 5\} ∩ \{1, 2, 3\} = \{1, 3\}$$

### Definition

> Two sets are called *disjoint* if their intersection is the empty set.

Example :

If A is the set of all odd numbers and B is the set of evens, then $A ∩ B = ∅$. So A and B are disjoint.

---

## Principle of inclusion-exclusion

$$|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|$$

This principle is important in enumeration.

### Definition

> Let A and B be sets. The *difference* of A and B, denoted  by $A - B$, is the set containing those elements that are in A but not in B. The difference of A and B is also called the *complement of B with respect to A*.

**Remark :** The difference of sets A and B is sometimes denoted A \ B.

$$A - B = \{x \text{ | } x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B\}$$

Example :

$$\{1, 3, 5\} - \{1, 2, 3\} = \{5\}$$

### Definition

> Let U be the universal set. The *complement* of the set A, denoted by $Ā$ is the complement of A with respect to U.

$$Ā = U - A$$

$$Ā = \{x ∈ U \text{ | } x ∉ A\}$$

The difference of A and B can be expressed as the intersection of A and the complement of B.

$$A - B = A ∩ B̄ $$

Example :

Use set builder notation and logical equivalences to establish DeMorgan's law : $\overline{A ∩ B} =  \overline{A} ∪ \overline{B}$

$$\overline{A ∩ B} = \{x \text{ | } x ∉ A ∩ B\} \text{ By Complement}$$

$$= \{x \text{ | } ¬(x ∈ (A ∩ B)\} \text{ By Negation}$$

$$= \{x \text{ | } ¬(x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B)\} \text{ By Intersection}$$

$$= \{x \text{ | } ¬(x ∈ A) ∨ ¬(x ∈ B)\} \text{ By DeMorgan's}$$

$$= \{x \text{ | } x ∉ A ∨ x∉ B\} $$

$$\{ x \text{ | } x ∈ \overline{A} ∨ x ∈ \overline{B}\} \text{ By Complement} $$

$$= \{x \text{ | } x ∈ \overline{A} ∪ \overline{B} \} \text{ By Union}$$

$$∴  \overline{A} ∪ \overline{B}$$

---

Set identities can also be proved using **membership tables**

---

$$\overline{A∪ (B ∩ C)} = (\overline{C} ∪ \overline{B}) ∩ \overline{A}$$

Proof:

$$\overline{A∪ (B ∩ C)} = \overline{A} ∩ (\overline{B ∩ C}) \text{ DeMorgan's Law} ⟹ \overline{A} ∩ (\overline{B} ∪ \overline{C})$$

$$⟹ (\overline{B} ∪ \overline{C}) ∩ \overline{A} \text{ Commutative law for intersections}$$

$$= (\overline{C} ∪ \overline{B}) ∩ \overline{A} \text{ Commutative law for unions}$$

## Generalized Unions and Interesections

### Definition:

The **union** of  collection of sets is the set that contains those elements that are members of at least one set in the collection.

**Notation :** 

$$A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ ... ∪ A_n = ⋃_{i = 1}^{n} A_i $$

The union of the sets $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$.

### Definition :

The **intersection** of  a collection of sets is thes et that contains those elements that are members of all the sets in the collection.

**Notation :** 

$$A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ ... ∩ A_n = ⋂ _{i = 1}^{n} A_i$$

to denote the intersection of the sets $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n $

---

Example :

For $i = 1, 2, ...,$ let $A_i = \{i, i + 1, i + 2, ... \}$. Then, 

$$⋃_{i = 1}^{n} A_i = ⋃_{i = 1}^{n} \{ i, i + 1, i + 2, .. \} = \{1, 2, 3, ... \}$$

and 

$$⋂_{i = 1}^{n}A_i = ⋂_{i = 1}^{n} \{i, i + 1, i + 2, ... \} = \{n, n + 1, n + 2, ... \} = A_n$$

We can extend the notation we have introduced for unions and intersections to other families of sets. 

**Notation**:

$$A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ ... ∪ A_n ∪ ... = ⋃_{i = 1}^{∞}A_i$$

The union of sets $A_1, A_2, ... , A_n, ...$. 

Similarly, the intersection of these sets is denoted by

$$A_1 ∩  A_2 ∩  ... ∩  A_n ∩  ... = \bigcap_{i = 1}^{∞}A_i$$

More generally,

$$⋂_{i ∈ I}A_i = \{x \text{ | } ∀i ∈ I (x ∈ A_i)\} $$

$$⋃_{i ∈ I}A_i = \{ x \text{ | } ∃ i ∈ I (x ∈ A_i)\}$$

---

Example :

Suppose $A_i = \{1, 2, 3, ..., i\}$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, ...$ Then, 

$$\bigcup_{i = 1}^{∞}A_i = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{∞} \{1, 2, 3, ..., i\} = \mathbb{Z}^{+}$$

and 

$$⋂_{i = 1}^{∞} A_i = ⋂_{i = 1}^{∞} \{1, 2, 3, ..., i\} = \{1\}$$

## Computer Representation of Sets

Let $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$ 

The bit string that represents the set of odd integers in $U$, namely, $\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$

$$\text{10 1010 1010}$$

Similarly for the even integers, 
$$\text{01 0101 0101}$$

Using bit strings to represent sets makes it easy to find complements of sets and unions, intersections, and differences of sets. 

⋆ So even and odd are complements.

The bit string for union is bitwise OR and the bit string for intersection is the bitwise AND.
